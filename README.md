## How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with 
different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very
simple: open two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
